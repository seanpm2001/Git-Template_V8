# Git-Template (Version 8) by [@Seanpm2001](https://github.com/seanpm2001/)

## Using this template

| ⚠️ **Warning:** _This `README.md` file is heavily out of date. Its instructions are dated, but still relevant._ |
|---|

Starting with version 8 of my series of templates, all the templates have been combined into one via Git branches.

# ⚠️ WARNING ⚠️

Before you complete forking this project, please make sure you have followed the following instructions, or this template will be of no use to you.

_The DeGoogle V2 template was used as a reference, as I haven't transformed the V8 template into a template yet at the time of writing this, and I needed a quick reference._

![/Setup/Graphics/Use-this-template-button.png](/Setup/Graphics/Use-this-template-button.png)

Click on the [use this template] button (don't fork the project)

![/Setup/Graphics/Include-Branches_Unchecked.png](/Setup/Graphics/Include-Branches_Unchecked.png)

Scroll down to the bottom and find this checkbox.

![/Setup/Graphics/Include-Branches_Checked.png](/Setup/Graphics/Include-Branches_Checked.png)

Check the box (this will fork all the branches required to use this set of templates)

## How to use this template

Once you have completed the template process listed above, you will have a fresh new repository with all the templates. The default branch is `main` but it is of no use for the template process.

There are currently 11 other branches. You can delete all the branches you don't want to use and set your preferred one as the default branch, or you can just switch the default branch to your preference.

Here is a guide to the 11 template branches:

> [`More branches have been added since. For now, you can find them here`](/Branches/README.md)

- `Template-SPM2001-Journaling` - This is my personal default journaling template for the Seanpm2001 life archive project
- `Template-SPM2001-Map` - This is my personal map data journaling template for the Seanpm2001 life archive project
- `Template-Snapcraft` - This is the snapcraft template for creating snap packages.
- `Template-SNU-Programming-Tools` - This is the SNU Programming Tools template for SNU projects related to the IDE collection set.
- `Template-SNU-Other` - This is a miscellaneous SNU template for other SNU projects.
- `Template-SNU-Default` - This is the default SNU template for general SNU projects.
- `Template-Meadows` - This is the template for the Meadows operating system project for its subprojects.
- `Template-GitHub-Pages-language` - This is my GitHub pages template for language category organizations.
- `Template-GitHub-Pages-default` - This is my GitHub pages template for general projects.
- `Template-DeGoogle` - This is my template for my DeGoogle article project series.
- `Template-Other` - This is my template for my other projects that don't fall under the other categories.

## Linguist note

the GitHub linguist (as of 2024, Thursday, August 22nd) doesn't show the language of individual branches until forked and set as the default branch. Sometimes you may need to make 1 commit before it shows on new repositories (HTML will always be shown first) The GitHub linguist seems to only display the languages of the main branch.

## Development

### V8 Template TODO

> `template` branches

- [x] Create template branches
- [ ] Too much disclaimer, try to find out how to do a dropdown (without turning the entire page into a giant text box) or comment some of it out for now λ
- [ ] Mobile version: success, no improvements needed (other than maybe a way to ease navigation and tell where to scroll) λ
- [ ] Repo directory, for description, tags, linked, and url (if none provided, use the "no description websites or URLs provided" that GitHub uses)
- [ ] UTC-7 clarification
- [ ] Swisscows support
- [ ] Safe.duckduckgo support
- [ ] Removal of parantheses in title line
- [ ] Highly advanced .gitattributes, .editorconfig, and .gitignore
- [ ] Google link (but it actually points to DeGoogle, don't be a jerk about it, just call it DeGoogle)
- [ ] Try to find a way to highlight more text or some other catchy way for important info, also clarify what is important λ
- [ ] Bold the text for the file info section headings, and file history section with bold, add support for MIME *.mkd and *.markdown
- [ ] HYBRID TEMPLATE: Mix of GitHub (pages) and Git (repository (normal))
- [ ] Separate branches for each template category, fit all your templates into one
- [ ] Update README files to specifically fit each branch
- [ ] Fix typos
- [ ] Add support for the Pull Request (PR) directory
- - [ ] I have done the following steps for all branches

> `main` branch

- [ ] Make the branch list in the `!USING_THIS_TEMPLATE` instruction file into a functional link list.
- [ ]  Archive all 11 branches into the main branch
- [x]  Archive all 11 pull requests
