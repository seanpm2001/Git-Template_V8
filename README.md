# SeansLifeArchive_Images_AdVenture_Communist_Part3
To ease the download and control of my AdCom stock images, images of gameplay from rank 60 to rank 70 have been uploaded here. This is the module for my life story project that contains more (3) of my AdVenture Communist gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly AdVenture Communist session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kongregate.mobile.adventurecommunist.google&hl=en_US&gl=US) there is a version available for iOS. It is listed below

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing AdVenture Communist in August of 2020. I played for a while, then had a long hiatus from it, before getting back into it. This game was the game that I was playing when I devised my weekly gaming schedule.

This repository is for pictures from rank 50 to rank 59.
