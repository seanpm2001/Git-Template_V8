### About

This was another major update to the template set. The following changes were made:

- [x] 10 new template branches were created, inheriting changes from above, branches of which include:
- - [x] `Template-Nix-Other` was created, branching out from `Template-Other`
- - [x] `Template-Shell-Other` was created, branching out from `Template-Other`
- - [x] `Template-INI-Other` was created, branching out from `Template-Other`
- - [x] `Template-Scheme-Other` was created, branching out from `Template-Other`

- [ ] 0 branches were updated
- [ ] 3 branches still need updates (Work is still needed on Bit City, Disco Zoo, and Lego Tower branches)

This release was created on Tuesday, August 27th. I could have added more branches, but I didn't want to spend more time here today, and I wanted to stay at 100 branches. I plan to only create 1 branch tomorrow, but also update the 3 branches that need updates. I made it to a total of 100 branches. I am past halfway through my queue, but my queue is still growing.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project right now.
