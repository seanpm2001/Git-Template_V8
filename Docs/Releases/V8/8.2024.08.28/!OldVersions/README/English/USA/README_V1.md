This release was created on Wednesday, August 28th. I could have added more branches, but I wanted to stick with 101 branches today, and because I have other projects I need to work on. I am past halfway through my queue, but my queue is still growing, albeit a lot slower now.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project right now.
