# Version 8 : Release 2024 August 18th

## V8.2024.08.18

### About

This was a minor update to the template set. The following changes were made:

- [x] `Template-Other` was modified
- - [x] `Template-GDScript-Other` `Template-AI2001` and `Template-UkraineHistorySimulator-Other` files were removed, as they didn't fit
- [x] 2 new template branches were created, inheriting changes from above, branches of which include:
- - [X] `Template-Seanpm2001-WorldDB-ImageVariant` was created, branching out from `Template-Other`
- - [x] `Template-Seanpm2001-WorldDB-StandardVariant` was created, branching out from `Template-Other`

This release was created on Saturday, August 17th. The power went out as I went to add a 3rd branch, and I had to quit work early. Work was wrapped up on this update today.

This was the first release in over a year. I hope to do more updates soon.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project anymore.
