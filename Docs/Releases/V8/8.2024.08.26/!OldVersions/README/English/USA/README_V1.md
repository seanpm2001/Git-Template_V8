This release was created on Saturday, August 26th. I could have added more branches, but I didn't want to spend more time here today. I made it to a total of 90 branches. I am about halfway through my queue, but my queue is still growing.

This release wasn't tagged, as I don't feel like tagging releases on this project right now.
