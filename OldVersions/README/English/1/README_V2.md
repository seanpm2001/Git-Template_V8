# SeansLifeArchive_Images_DiscoZoo
The module for my life story project that contains my Disco Zoo gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all weekly fISCO zOO session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nimblebit.discozoo&hl=en_US&gl=USS) there is a version available for iOS. It is listed below

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Disco Zoo in mid 2020 during my NimbleBit fan phase. I continue to play on a weekly basis.
