# SeansLifeArchive_Images_TinyDeathStar
The module for my life story project that contains my NimbleBit √ó Disney: Tiny Death Star gameplay images. Unfortunately, this game randomly got pulled over half a decade ago, and can't be installed normally. Even then, it hasn't received updates in over 6 years, and all online functionality is gone. More information is available in this repositories README.md file.

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my daily Tiny Death Star session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store) but when I originally played in 2013/2014, I also played the Android version. The game has been pulled from Android as of 2014, so how did I get it in 2020? I will explain in the next paragraph.

Recently on November 17th 2020, I was mass-downloading apps on my new Samsung Galaxy S20 FE (as of November 20th 2020, I am up to a total of 1091 apps) and I came across a nostalgic gold mine with my grandpas Google Play account, which spans back to 2008. I was able to re-download several games, including Tiny Death Star, as they had been downloaded in the past. I tested it on November 19th 2020, and the app still works. I am worrying that it may not work in Android 11. Of course, the app has no online functionality, but it is still completely playable. Apparently, you can still get the game without using this method, but you can't get it on Android or iOS, it is currently only officially supported on Amazon's FreeTime service.

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images. You can learn more about Tiny Tower Vegas by [clicking/tapping here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars%3A_Tiny_Death_Star).

I played the game in the past on Android from 2013 to 2013 during a hotel stay. I played in the lobby. I made it to 7 floors, but didn't play any further.

I started playing again on November 19th 2020. I have been playing weekly ever since November 20th 2020.
