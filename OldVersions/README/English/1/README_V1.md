# SeansLifeArchive_Images_Boom-Beach
The module for my life story project that contains my Boom Beach gameplay images.

***

## About

See above. This repository hosts all my weekly Boom Beach session pictures. I currently play the [Android version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.supercell.boombeach&hl=en)

These weekly pictures are to be used for progress monitoring, but can also be used as stock images.

I started playing Boom Beach all the way back in 2014. Even though it was before 2015, I didn't play play the [iOS version](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/boom-beach/id672150402).

I started playing the game again a few times, from 2014 to 2015, then from 2015 to 2018, then again in 2020.
